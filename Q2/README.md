# Question 2
Each new term in Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the two previous terms which starts by 1 and 2.The initial 10 terms will be:
1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,...

find the sum even-valued terms which not exceed than 4 billion.


> **Tip:** you can use `4e6` or `4*10**6` instead of `4000000` but mention that there is a little difference between `4e6` and `4*10**6`*(what?)*.
